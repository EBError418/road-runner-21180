/**
 * Game pad buttons design:
 * Game Pad1:
 *  Left stick:
 *      left-right: strafe robot
 *      up-down:    drive root
 *  Right stick:
 *      left-right: turn robot
 *  dpad:
 *      left:       robot movement speed down
 *      right:      robot movement speed up
 *      up:         normal auto pickup the 3rd cone from cone stack
 *      down:       normal auto pickup the 4th and 5th cone from cone stack
 *  X:              robot movement speed down (same as dpad_left)
 *  B:              robot movement speed down (same as dpad_right)
 *  Left Bumper:    normal auto pickup cone from ground
 *  Right bumper:   normal auto drop off cone
 *  Left trigger:   auto pick up cone from cone base then move to high junction, slider lifted to high junction
 *  Right trigger:  auto drop off cone on high junction then move to cone base
 *  Y:              Teapot function - drop off cone on high junction then pick up cone from base, then move to high junction
 *  Back:           Back to cone base just at the beginning of Teleop
 *  A:              open claw to drop off cone manually.*
 * Game pad2:
 *  dpad:
 *      Up:         close the claw to pick up cone
 *      Down:       open claw to drop off cone manually
 *  Right stick:
 *                  left-right: manually control slider up and down
 *  X:              move slider to wall position
 *  A:              move slider to low junction position
 *  B:              move slider to medium junction position
 *  Y:              move slider to high junction position
 *  Right bumper:   move slider to ground junction position
 *  Right trigger:  move slider to ground position
 *  Left stick:
 *      left-right: manually control arm position
 *      up:         move arm to pick up position
 *      down:       move arm to drop off position
